**License:** LGPL-3.0-or-later  
**Project:** [tum-bash](https://github.com/Archetypum/tum-bash.git)

Bash wrapper for interacting with the `portage` package manager. Provides convenient functions to run common `portage` commands with standardized success/error output and execution logging.

`portage` is commonly used on **Gentoo GNU/Linux**-based operating systems.

## Usage

Unfortunately, `lib/package_manager/portage.sh` is _**not finished and will be not finished**_ in first stable release (v0.0.1-stable).

`portage` support is open for pull requests.
