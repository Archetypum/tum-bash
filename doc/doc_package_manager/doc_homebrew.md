# `lib/package_manager/homebrew.sh` â€” brew Wrapper Library

Bash wrapper for interacting with the `homebrew` package manager. Provides convenient functions to run common `brew` commands with standardized success/error output and execution logging.

`homebrew` is commonly used on **macOS**-based operating systems.

## Usage

Import this library in your Bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

source lib/package_manager/homebrew.sh
```

## Functions

### Core Helper

`execute <command> [args...]`

Runs the given command with arguments, printing a green success message if the command succeeds or a red error message if it fails.

### brew Command Wrappers

Each function wraps a specific `brew` command or flag:
